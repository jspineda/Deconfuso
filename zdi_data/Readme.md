# zdi_data
This is where the literature ZDI results go. We need to be able to reproduce the "confusogram" with this data!

The main papers we're drawing from:
- Donati+2008: *Large-scale magnetic topologies of early M dwarfs*
- Morin+2008: *Large-scale magnetic topologies of mid M dwarfs*
- Morin+2010: *Large-scale magnetic topologies of late M dwarfs*
